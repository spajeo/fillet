# fillit

After finishing `libft`, fillit is the second mandatory projectbefore to branch out. The purpose is to make the smallest possible "square" (which can contain holes) with a given list of tetriminos, but the disposition must be as such that it returns the first possible solution when placing them recursively from the top left.

# Compiling
Run make, an executable called fillit should compile directly. Please submit an issue if you run into any.
